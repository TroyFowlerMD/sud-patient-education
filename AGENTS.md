# Project: SUD Patient Education

## Identity
- GitHub is the source of truth for this project: TroyFowlerMD/sud-patient-education.
- Notion is no longer the operating source of truth for this repo. Historical Notion content has been migrated into docs/ and the repo memory files.
- Durable documentation lives in docs/, AGENTS.md, TASKS.md, WORKLOG.md, and DECISIONS.md.
- Work in this repo in place. Do not move folders, clone over this repo, or rewrite history unless Dr. Fowler explicitly asks.
- Default branch: main.
- Live/public target: https://troyfowlermd.github.io/sud-patient-education/.

## Project Overview
- Patient-facing substance use disorder education hub for adults in inpatient addiction treatment.
- Provides plain-language, printable materials that support clinician-led conversations.
- Does not collect patient data or provide individualized medical advice.

- index.html - patient education hub

## Required Startup Routine
1. Run git status --short --branch in the repo root and confirm the branch sync state with origin.
2. If there are staged, modified, or untracked files, stop and report exactly what is present before editing. Summarize whether the changes appear intentional, stale, unexpected, or in need of user review. Treat those changes as user or prior-Codex work; do not discard, overwrite, pull over, or auto-clean them without explicit approval.
3. If the working tree is clean and network access is available, run git pull --ff-only before starting work. Do not merge, rebase, or force update unless explicitly approved.
4. Read AGENTS.md, TASKS.md, WORKLOG.md, DECISIONS.md, and any task-relevant files in docs/.
5. Report the current branch, repo status, active task, blockers, and proposed next action.
6. Wait for approval before editing unless the user has already given explicit implementation approval.

## Required Shutdown Routine
1. Update WORKLOG.md with what changed, what remains, and any blockers.
2. Update TASKS.md if task status changed.
3. Update DECISIONS.md if an architectural, workflow, safety, or publishing decision was made.
4. Run the relevant tests/checks, or explain why they were not run.
5. Run git status --short --branch and summarize the exact staged, modified, and untracked files, including whether any remaining local changes appear intentional, stale, unexpected, or in need of user review.
6. By default, after approved work is complete and relevant checks have passed, commit and push automatically unless Dr. Fowler explicitly says not to push yet. Stop and ask before committing or pushing if the changes are unclear, checks fail, deployment/config/secrets are involved, or the repo appears production-sensitive.
7. End every shutdown with an explicit "Shutdown Receipt" section. Do not end with a generic "Done" only.
8. The Shutdown Receipt must visibly report:
   - WORKLOG.md: updated or not updated, with a one-line summary.
   - TASKS.md: updated or not updated, with any task status changes.
   - DECISIONS.md: updated or not updated, with a one-line summary.
   - Tests/checks: commands run, or why none were run.
   - Commit: hash and commit message if a commit was made, or "not committed" with the reason.
   - Push: pushed successfully, failed with reason, or not pushed with the reason.
   - Final git status: exact final status result.

## Worklog Entry Format
Append entries to WORKLOG.md using this shape:

    ### YYYY-MM-DD - [machine/profile] - [session summary]
    - Completed: ...
    - In progress: ...
    - Blockers/notes: ...

## Cross-Machine Rules
- Never assume prior chat context is available. Reconstruct state from Git, TASKS.md, WORKLOG.md, DECISIONS.md, and docs/.
- Use git pull --ff-only only when the working tree is clean.
- Avoid destructive Git operations such as reset --hard, force pushes, history rewrites, or deleting untracked work unless explicitly approved.
- Keep generated context inside this repo's memory files and docs/ so another Windows account or computer can resume.
- Do not store secrets, tokens, credentials, private keys, or unnecessary sensitive data in repo docs.
- Preserve user or prior-Codex changes that are already in the working tree.

## Owner Communication
- The repo owner is new to Git, GitHub, GitHub Desktop, Codex, local-vs-remote repository concepts, commits, branches, remotes, pushes, pulls, and deployment workflows.
- When explaining repo work, include a little extra context by default: define the concept, explain why it matters, then give the specific instruction or recommendation.
- Use plain outcome language before technical terms. For example, say "this saves the change in local history" before or alongside "commit."
- Distinguish clearly between local files, local commits, pushed GitHub commits, pull requests, and live deployed website changes.
- Give step-by-step instructions with exact paths, button names, branch names, and GitHub URLs when the user is operating tools manually.
- Recommend the simplest safe option first, and name when an action is optional versus required.
- Avoid implying the live website changed unless changes were actually pushed and deployed.

## Project-Specific Rules
- Keep this repo patient-facing and separate from clinician-facing sud-education-hub.
- Dashboard links should point to the hub, not individual topic pages.
- Topic pages should use plain language, visible safety guidance, and printable handout formatting.
- Do not add symptom checkers, calculators, taper schedules, or individualized treatment advice.
- Use local assets only; avoid external embeds that could create privacy or availability issues.
- Keep emergency/safety guidance visible on patient-facing pages.

## Verification Guidance
- For new topics, review plain-language tone, safety guidance, and print behavior.
- For routing changes, verify the main dashboard links to the hub page only unless explicitly changed.
- If tests cannot run, record the reason in WORKLOG.md.
